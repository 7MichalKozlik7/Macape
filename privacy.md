# Privacy Policy

**Last updated: December 17, 2025**

## Introduction

Macape ("we", "our", or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our macOS cursor manager application.

## Information We Collect

**We do not collect any personal information.**

Macape is designed to operate entirely on your local device. The app:

- Does not require user registration or accounts
- Does not collect or transmit personal data
- Does not use analytics or tracking services
- Does not access your contacts, calendar, or other personal information

## Local Data Storage

Macape stores the following data locally on your device:

- **User Preferences:** Your selected cursor theme, scale settings, and app preferences
- **Downloaded Themes:** Cursor theme files downloaded from GitHub repositories
- **Cache Data:** Parsed cursor images for faster loading

This data never leaves your device and is stored in your user Library folder.

## Network Connections

Macape connects to the internet only when:

- **Downloading cursor themes:** The app downloads theme files from GitHub release pages
- These downloads are one-time per theme and cached locally

We do not log, track, or analyze your download activity.

## Third-Party Services

Macape downloads cursor themes from public GitHub repositories. These repositories are maintained by their respective authors. We do not control these third-party services.

The cursor themes are distributed under open-source licenses (GPL-3.0, LGPL-3.0, CC-BY-SA-4.0, MIT).

## Data Security

Since all data is stored locally on your macOS device, it is protected by your system's security measures, including FileVault encryption if enabled.

## Accessibility Permissions

Macape requires Accessibility permissions to:

- Track mouse position for the cursor overlay
- Hide the system cursor

These permissions are used solely for cursor rendering and are not used to monitor your activity.

## Children's Privacy

Macape does not collect any personal information from anyone, including children under 13 years of age.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated revision date.

## Contact Us

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us through our GitHub repository.
